- Changed the input checks to allow the format penalized(response~unpenalized, penalized). This is in line with functions such as lme.
- Fixed a bug in .coxmerge() that resulted in alignment mistakes in the cross-validated predicted survival curves.
- Added the advice to the vignette to add an L2 penalty in case of multi-level factors.

- Fixed a bug in penalized() and all cvl-functions that sometimes caused name conflicts because the terms of user-supplied formulae would first be evaluated in the package name space. All eval() calls are now explicitly directed to the correct environment.

- New method basesurv() returns the baseline suvival.
- basehaz() now returns the baseline hazard instead of the baseline survival curve.
- The center argument in basehaz() and basesurv() implemented.
- linear.predictors() method added for penfit objects.
- Missing documentation of fitted.values() added.
- as.data.frame() method added for breslow objects.
