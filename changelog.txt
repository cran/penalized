- Implemented the survival function for breslow objects
- Made storing of all cross-validated predictors in profL1 and profL2 optional.
- Implemented the predict function.
- Streamlined the cross-validated predictions, so that predictions are calculated and stored per fold rather than per subject.
- Fixed an input check bug that prevented counting process type input for survival data.
- Changed the default value of maxlambda1 in profL1 and optL1, so that maxlambda1 is now the maximal value at which any non-zero regressioncoefficient pops up in any cross-validation fold.
- Added positivity check for survival response
- Implemented the possibility of including an offset term
- Added .modelswitch and .predictswitch functions to reduce code duplication
- Implemented the Poisson model

- Changed the index entry of the vignette from "penalized" to "Penalized user guide".


0.9-19 (2007-12-21)

0-9-18 (2007-12-14)
- Added the posibility of putting a positivity constraint on all penalized covariates.
- Changed the illogical behavior that setting steps=k led to an output list of length k+1.


0-9.17 (2007-12-01)
- New internal function .checkinput() does improved common input preprocessing for penalized(), cvl(), profL1(), profL2(), optL1() and optL2(), removing much code duplication. The function replaces .prepare() which previously did part of the common input preprocessing.
- Streamlining in .checkinput() also made the functions .lmgamma(), .coxgamma() and .logitgamma() obsolete.
- A new function .getFolds() for calculating cross-validation folds also removed much duplicated code.
- The possibility of giving different lambda1 or lambda2-values for different covariates has been removed, as it was badly implemented. The option may return in the future.


0.9-16 (2007-11-16)

- New method basesurv() returns the baseline suvival.
- basehaz() now returns the baseline hazard instead of the baseline survival curve.
