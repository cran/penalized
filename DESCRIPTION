Description: Fitting possibly high dimensional penalized
        regression models. The penalty structure can be any combination
        of an L1 penalty (lasso and fused lasso), an L2 penalty (ridge) and a
        positivity constraint on the regression coefficients. The
        supported regression models are linear, logistic and Poisson
        regression and the Cox Proportional Hazards model.
        Cross-validation routines allow optimization of the tuning
        parameters.
